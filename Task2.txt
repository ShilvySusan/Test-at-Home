Task2
=====
Imagine a server with the following specs:
● 4 times Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-4830 v4 @ 2.00GHz
● 64GB of ram
● 2 tb HDD disk space
● 2 x 10Gbit/s nics
The server is used for SSL offloading and proxies around 25000 requests per second.
Please let us know which metrics are interesting to monitor in that specific case and
how would you do that? What are the challenges of monitoring this?

Metrices I find interesting to monitor:
======================================
1. CPU Usage
------------
Since server is set up for ssl offloading and proxies, decryption and encryption of incoming traffic can consume  CPU resource highly. Also in parallel, if there are other 
computations, it also needs to be taken care off by the CPU.

2. Memory Usage
--------------
In a proxy network, data caching is performed by the server to speed up the requests. Also enough memory is required in the other computations of CPU as well.

3. Network Traffic
-----------------
Incoming request can exceed the configured limitation(>2 x 10Gbit/s nics) which ends up in down network.

4.Disk space usage
-----------------
It also needs to be monitored in case of the bulk data(2TB HDD) storage on a daily basis.

5.Network Uptime
----------------
Availability of network to the end user.

6. SSL certificate expiry
------------------------
SSL certificate expiry can cause inaccessibility of the system.

7. DDoS and DoS Threat
----------------------
An unusual traffic, like one instant(DoS) or multiple instant(DDoS) continuously trying to access the system through many ports for a long time, can interrupt the service to other users.


How would I do monitoring:
=========================
1. Thorough daily health checks of the system.
2. Instant alerts for metrics exceeding the threshold value as well as for down services , network, or connectivity through mail system.
3. Making continuous improvements in the checks of respective monitoring tool like monitoring intervals, priortised checks for certain services etc.
4. During critical times, manual log monitoring , using command line interface tool monitoring( eg: netstat, w, top, etc).


What are the challenges:
========================
1. Sometimes usage metrics exceeds threshold values for short span of time. In this case a large number of notifications can get filled with our inbox.
2. If the above alert is customized so that whenever it occurs, a ticket will be created. Then it becomes unnecessary.
3. Also for some reason, if we disabled the alert for a particular service and forgot to re-enable it, it can be a challenge to monitoring.
