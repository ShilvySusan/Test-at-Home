Task 1
======
Please design a script that writes the numbers from 1 - 10 in random order.
Each number should appear only once. You can use bash only.
Please provide tests for the script, along with documentation which should include
the following:
● Build instructions
● Usage
● Description
● Known limitations / bugs

Build instructions & Description
--------------------------------
1. Create a file 'Script.sh' and give permissions
2. Display numbers from 1-10
3. Give the output from step2 as the input to tr (translate or delete characters) command using pipeline.
4. Translate the space to a new line and get the output as a drop down list using 2 sets (' ' & '\n') with 'tr'.
5. Give the output of step4 as input using pipiline to sort command with an option -R which is used for Random sort.
6. Execute the file Script.sh
7. Output will give numbers from 1-10 in random order without the repetition of any number. 

Usage
-----
1. vim Script.sh

#!/bin/bash

echo {1..10} | tr ' ' '\n' | sort -R

2. chmod 755 Script.sh
3. ./Script.sh

Known limitations/ bugs
-----------------------

I have started  and ended up with below inferences:

1. $RANDOM,default bash function for generating random numbers, gives numbers which will repeat.  

echo $[ ( $RANDOM % 10 )  + 1 ]

2. To avoid the repetition;
    1. We need to store the values in a file
    2. Then compare the generated value using grep command with the file as input and conditional loops for iteration.
       But while using conditional loops, they can end up in infinite loop or an incomplete output.
